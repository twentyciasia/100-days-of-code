The log of my #100DaysOfCode.

Started on Jan 09, 2018.

## Log

### D1
Today I've started the chat application using nodejs, mongodb and angular. I setup the environment, init project, 
learned how to authenticate with json web tokens and design database

### D2
Today I implemented the signup function, signin, but they did not work well. 
At first I had some trouble with mongodb and express js due to lack of experience.
