The log of my #100DaysOfCode (to keep separate from main repo and let others fork a clean version).

Started on Jan 08, Monday, 2018.

## Log

### D1 (08/01/2018)
- I have started to build my project.
- Init code base, install some package which I need and config some global settings.
- Today maybe I took many times for this easy stuff. Because I met a problem with Homestead and about .dev domain doesn't work on Chrome. I researched and fixed them. The first day was not really good, but... keep go ahead :D :D

### D2 (09/01/2018)
- Today I have made authentication for my app.
- I took 2 hours for this task, but it didn't work as my purpose. There are some errors that I don't know why.
- Tomorrow, I will fix and start to build my backend

### D2 (10/01/2018)
- Today I go out without laptop. So I cannot code.
- I read book: Laravel Code Smart in 2 hours.
- I also update log-day late because the same reason.
